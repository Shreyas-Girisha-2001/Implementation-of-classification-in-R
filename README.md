# Implementation-of-classification-in-R

In order to implement classification in R, data must be prepared, a classification method must be selected, the data must be split, the algorithm must be trained, its performance must be assessed, the parameters must be adjusted, and the model must be deployed for prediction. For each of these processes, R offers a large selection of tools and functions, making it a popular option for categorisation assignments.
